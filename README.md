### Hey there fellow stranger 👋

I am Xavier a fellow AI and App enthusiast. I mainly focus on developing AI and Native Android apps. I really fascinate about the endless possibility there is, for 
advancements in both AI and app developements. In the field of AI, I am mainly focused on supervised learning(classification/regression) and reinforcement learning. In 
terms of app developement, I am working towards being a full stack app developer.
